    <p>In Italian cuisine it is made of stacked layers of pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking.</p>
    <h1>Ingredents</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce)</li>
        <li>béchamel sauce</li>
        <li>vegetables</li>
        <li>cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan)</li>
        <li>seasonings and spices</li>
        <li>grated cheese, which melts during baking.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li>Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li>Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li>Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
    </ol>
